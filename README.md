# IPL DATA ANALYSIS EXCEL FOR DASHBOARD
Here's the visualization from my First project " Excel dashboard focusing on IPL analysis from 2008 to 2020. " that I built entirely on Excel.

The Dashboard is fully Dynamic and each category of data is fully functional. It gives a basic overview of every IPL seasons all the way from IPL 2008 to IPL 2022.
A single season can be chosen to display the stats as well as multiple seasons can be selected to show the combined stats for those seasons using the slicer.
